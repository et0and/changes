# I Ching 

[Use it!](https://nphollon.github.io/iching)

This program generates I Ching readings. The hexagrams are random, with probabilities that correspond to the traditional "Three Coins" method. Broken and unbroken lines appear with equal likelihood. Lines have a 1 in 4 chance of changing between the first and second hexagram. Changing lines are indicated by a red dot. 

The names of the hexagrams are taken from the Wilhelm & Baynes translation. You can read the text of this translation [here](http://www.pantherwebworks.com/i_ching/).

The program is written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org). It is licensed under the [GNU Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html), so you can use the code freely.
